# Pan
Work in progress JS runtime environment.  
  
Uses [ChakraCore](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore), you will need to build it and copy ChakraCore.dll to the output directory  
  
Supports loading of some CommonJS modules but not all, such as those that rely on NodeJS or ones like lodash, working on solving this.  
  
The CLI is very buggy.
